For the longest time, I was remarkably indifferent to any career paths. That changed rather abruptly around 11th grade. With mounting expectations from my family to pursue a career in medicine, I realized I didn’t actually want to. At the time, I told everyone it was because I couldn’t handle the gore, but in retrospect, I think it had more to do with my innate rebellion to being pushed into things.

That decision or lack-thereof led me toward research and academia. It felt like a way to reclaim agency over what I wanted to do with my life, and the prospect of earning a “Dr.” title through a PhD helped me reassure my family that it was still a ``respectable pursuit". In my senior secondary years, I studied physics, chemistry, mathematics, and biology. Math fascinated me with its logic, problem-solving, and the way it forced me to think rigorously. Biology, on the other hand, came naturally and easily, and a chapter on biotechnology fascinated me. It was the closest thing to ‘pop science’ in the syllabus, and the naïve dream of curing cancer made it feel meaningful.

For higher education, I initially joined NISER Bhubaneswar and, two months later, transferred to IISER Pune to focus on biology, as it was one of the best places in the country for studying the subject. Over the next three years, I took the full spectrum of courses in the sciences and humanities. I loved mathematics, but struggled in exams despite putting in immense effort. Biology felt less engaging, yet I performed well with minimal preparation. Somewhere between trying to reconcile these differences, I realized two things- I genuinely enjoyed the academic process, and I was deeply drawn to the analytical, reasoning-driven aspects of problem-solving, rather than the purely empirical or experimental ones.

Humanities courses—especially economics, development studies, and public policy made me think about systems, equity, and how collective decisions shape society. I’ve always been motivated by the idea of contributing to the public good, and these subjects provided a framework for that drive.

Near the end of my third year, by pure chance, I discovered computational social choice, a field that tastefully combined my interests in mathematics, economics, and social decision-making. I spent months reading papers, reaching out to researchers, and attending every summer and winter school I could find on algorithms, game theory, and theoretical computer science.

Eventually, I began working on my master’s thesis under the guidance of Professors Siddharth Barman, Erel Segal-Halevi, and Hadi Hosseini, focusing on problems in fair division, a widely studied topic in computational social choice. 

Looking ahead, I intend to pursue a PhD in computational social choice, with a focus on multi-agent decision-making processes and applications, especially in participatory budgeting and other democratic mechanisms. My long-term goal is to help design systems and policies that make collective decision-making not only efficient but genuinely fair.
